STM32F429I-DiscoLCD
===================
This project is a part of the DiscoPhone project which is our embedded class project in 2014.

I split the DiscoPhone project into three parts
* [DiscoLCD](https://github.com/STM32F429I-DiscoPhone/STM32F429I-DiscoLCD)
* [F9-microkernel porting](https://github.com/STM32F429I-DiscoPhone/f9-kerenl-porting)
* [ZTK-SIM900A GPRS module APIs](https://github.com/STM32F429I-DiscoPhone/ZTK-SIM900A)

DiscoLCD

In this part we want to build our DiscoPhone's UI and control flow.
